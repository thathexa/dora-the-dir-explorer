I would call it "Conservation of Liguistic Complexity" but in order to prevent confusion among physicists, due to the fact that this phenomenon is much different than alike physics terms - i.e. conservation of energy  - I decided to you an alternative term, and thus the following phenomenon will be from here on named "Constancy of Liguistic Complexity".
